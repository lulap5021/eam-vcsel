A fork of the work I realised when doing my Ph.D. at CNRS LAAS on Electroabsorption modulator integrated on a Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (EAM-VCSEL).
This code uses Lengyel's model for calculating the absorption in the quantum wells, and transfer matrix method using scattering matrices to calculate the reflectivity at the surface level, and the optical power within the structure layers.

If you want to do something similar check out https://github.com/edmundsj/rcwa with a more elegant and polyvalent solution in Python.
